# Jotto server-client GUI

This is a project inspired by the problem assignment 7 of the 6.005 MIT course. It follows thoroughly
the steps indicated in the Instructions.pdf file, but adapts them to the Python language and its environment.
A Jotto server component is also provided, since the address provided in the problem assignment gives back
a 403 error.
