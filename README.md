# Jotto Web

This project was inspired by problem assignment 7 of the
[6.005 MIT course (2011 version)](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/106923).
It does not follow carefully the steps described in the `Instructions.pdf` document, but its aim is to build something
very similar to that proposed in the assignment, albeit with a different language, libraries and even added
features. In particular, Python and Django were used to build this assignment's project.

I chose not to pick the technologies recommended in the assignment because as of 2017 Java Swing is
a bit outdated, and even because I was more interested in developing with Python than with another
language.

## Usage
To run this project a basic knowledge of the Django framework is recommended. To do it locate the `manage.py` file and
type on a console (or on a run configuration) `python manage.py runserver`. The initial output should
display the port at which the Web server is listening.
